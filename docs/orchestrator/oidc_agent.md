# Setup oidc-agent

oidc-agent is a set of tools to manage OpenID Connect tokens and make them easily usable from the command line. We followed the ssh-agent design, so users can handle OIDC tokens in a similiar way as they do with ssh keys.

Admin and user guides are available [here](https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/)

## Installation

```bash
wget https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent/releases/download/v3.2.7/oidc-agent-3.2.7-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install libmicrohttpd libsodium
sudo rpm -i oidc-agent-3.2.7-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
oidc-agent --version
```

Edit your `.bashrc` to make oidc-agent persistent, adding the following line:

```bash
test -e ~/.oidc-agent.env && . ~/.oidc-agent.env
```

Then run the agent as follows:

```bash
oidc-agent > ~/.oidc-agent.env
```

and load the environment again:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Account Configuration

!!! attention
    You need to have a valid account in [DODAS IAM](https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/) to proceed with the configuration.

`oidc-gen` is used to generate new account configurations. 
Account configurations are identified by a shortname. This shortname can be set to anything, but it is recommended to use a descriptive name of the provider / account used. E.g. `dodas`

Run the following command:

```bash
oidc-gen --flow device dodas
```

You will get the following output:
```bash

Issuer [https://iam-test.indigo-datacloud.eu/]:
```
Provide the DODAS IAM url: `https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/`

!!! warning
    The trailing `/` in the issuer is very important! Don't forget it.

Then you will asked for the following:
```bash
This issuer supports the following scopes: openid profile email address phone offline_access
Space delimited list of scopes or 'max' [openid profile offline_access]:
```

You can just type ENTER since the suggested scopes are sufficient for our purposes.

After that, you will get the following output:
```bash
Registering Client ...
Generating account configuration ...
accepted

Using a browser on another device, visit:
https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/device

And enter the code: UU2F47
```

As suggested, open your browser and follow the link, then enter the code.

You will be asked to approve the registered client as shown in the image below.

[![client approval](img/oidc_agent_client_approval.png)](img/oidc_agent_client_approval.png)

After your approval, the `oidc_gen` command will automatically move to the next step allowing you to set an optional password for configuration encryption:
 

```bash
Enter encryption password for account configuration 'dodas':
Confirm encryption Password:
```


## Test the configuration

In order to verify the correct setup, try to get a token using the `oidc-token` command:
```bash
oidc-token dodas
```

If everything is working fine you will get your token in the command output. E.g.:
```bash
$ oidc-token dodas
