[The INDIGO PaaS Orchestrator](https://github.com/indigo-dc/orchestrator) allows to instantiate resources on Cloud Management Frameworks (like OpenStack and OpenNebula) platforms based on deployment requests that are expressed through templates written in [TOSCA YAML Simple Profile v1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.0/csprd01/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0-csprd01.html), and deploys them on the best cloud site available.
